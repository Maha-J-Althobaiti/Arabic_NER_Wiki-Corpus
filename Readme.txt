WDC dataset adheres to the CoNLL 2003 annotation guidelines and CoNLL NE types which include Person, Location, Organisation, and Miscellaneous
List of tags with associated categories of names can be found here
http://www.cnts.ua.ac.be/conll2003/ner/annotation.txt

The annotation style of the WDC dataset followed the CoNLL format, where 
each token and its tag are placed together in the same file in the form 
< token > \s < tag >. 
The NE boundary is specified using the BIO representation scheme,
where B- indicates the beginning of the NE, 
      I refers to the continuation (Inside) of the NE, 
      and O indicates that the word is not a NE.

There might be some errors in NER annotations as a result of errors in our annotation software. 
However, the good quality of WDC dataset was proved when testing on gold-standard datasets.
The methodology adopted by annotation software and evalauation results can be found in the
paper.
